**Our Philosophy**

We enjoy taking some time from our full time jobs, some of us as a web designer & developer and work on projects that can be used and shared with you and others for both personal and commercial use. We believe in the open source philosophy and thank that this will be the great future. Why compete when we can cooperate and become better?

Over time, we have published quit a good amount of collection of free open source projects now, used by thousands of people. And we couldn't be any happier.

If for some reason you would like to reward us and buy us coffee, we would really appreciate that alot. It would help tremendously! In exchange, you can remove any credit that links to Crafty Devs, if of course thats all you want ðŸ¥°

You can track all of our projects here on the website or on our [repository](https://github.com/CraftyDevelopers) anytime

This will be updated soon!
